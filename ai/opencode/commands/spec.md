description: Interview to flesh out a plan/spec
---

I roughly outlined what I plan to do in the SPEC.md file.

Interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestion tool. Ask about technical implementation, UI & UX, edge cases,
concerns, tradeoffs. Don't ask obvious questions, dig into the hard parts I might not have considered.

Keep interviewing until we've covered everything, then write a complete spec to SPEC.md.
