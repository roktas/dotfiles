description: Make state machine diagrams of a component
---

Given the component in $ARGUMENTS, do the following in order:

1. Break it down into key states, transitions, and events.
2. Generate a comprehensive state machine diagram in ASCII art format, covering all paths, edge cases, loops, and error
   handling.
3. Explain how this diagram verifies system correctness, identifies lazy paths or bugs, and suggest improvements.
